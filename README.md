# UDIESE-Infrastructure-for-Schools-in-India-Analysis
This project analyzes the availability and quality of basic school infrastructure across India using data from UDISE+ (Unified District Information System for Education). The aim was to create a clear, interactive dashboard and a structured data story that highlight differences across states, school categories, management types, and rural–urban segments.

Project Overview

The dashboard explores multiple infrastructure indicators, including:
1) Internet access
2) Computers
3) Electricity
4) Drinking water (tap vs non-tap)
5) Toilets (Boys/Girls)
6) Handwashing facilities
7) Medical checkups
8) Ramps and inclusive facilities
9) It provides a multi-dimensional view of India’s school infrastructure through maps, bar charts, comparative visuals, and an interactive story flow.

Key Features

1) Interactive Filters: Facility type, management type, school category
2) State-Level Map: Identifies where coverage is strongest or weakest
3) Rural vs Urban Comparison: Visualizes the infrastructure divide
4) Govt vs Private Analysis: Highlights ownership-based differences
5) Maintenance Gap View: Compares “available” vs “functional” facilities
6) Water Safety Section: Compares tap vs other sources across states

 Core Insights:-
1) Strong disparities exist across states, especially in digital facilities.
2) The rural–urban divide remains significant for internet and toilets.
3) Private schools outperform in computer and internet access, while government schools do better in some basic amenities.
4) Many states show a high availability but low functionality gap, indicating maintenance issues.
5) Drinking water safety varies widely, with several states relying heavily on non-tap sources.

 Tools & Skills Used:-

1)Tableau Public for dashboarding and storytelling
2)UDISE+ official datasets
3)Data cleaning, reshaping, and exploratory analysis
4)Visualization and insight communication

 Purpose:-

This project demonstrates the ability to work with real government data, build interactive dashboards, and present insights clearly—relevant for roles in data analysis, BI, consulting, social sector analytics, and impact-focused research.
